# landmark-recognition
building models that recognize the correct landmark (if any) in a dataset of challenging test images.



Problem :
Image retrieval is a fundamental problem in computer vision: given a query image, can you find similar images in a large database? This is especially important for query images containing landmarks, which accounts for a large portion of what people like to photograph.

A query images and, for each query, are expected to retrieve all database images containing the same landmarks (if any). This  will proceed in two phases: The 1st phase will use the same test and index sets as last year, while for phase 2 we will process a completely new dataset that contains 700K images with more than 100K unique landmarks. We hope that this release will accelerate progress in this important research problem.
